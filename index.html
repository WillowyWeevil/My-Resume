                <p>I began my career at Walgreens as a cashier. I worked in the photo department processing, developing and crafting orders steadily and efficiently as they came through our system.
                    I worked diligently for four months, helping customers to create and preserve memories. When a Shift Lead position became available, I quickly put my name in. 
                    Knowing my reputation as a hard worker, I was promoted and now lead crews of employees, educating and inspiring to be the best we can.
                    I am tasked with handling customer complaints and ensuring our guests have the best experience they can at our store, while also taking care of my employees and their needs.
                    As a shift lead new opportunities were offered to me. I now report directly to asset protection every week about our losses and any suspicious activity, I am also in charge of paying back loans and ordering loans to keep our safe even.
